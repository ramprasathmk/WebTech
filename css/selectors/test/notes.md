# CSS Selectors [03/11/2025]

## Selectors in CSS
  - Selectors are used to select or target the element to apply CSS.

  - **Types**
    1. Simple Selector 
    2. Combinator Selector 
    3. Pseudo Class Selector 
    4. Pseudo Element Selector 
    5. Attribute Selector 

## 1. Simple Selector

- **Types**
  - TagName Selector
  - Id Name Selector (#)
  - Class Name Selector (.)
  - Universal Selector (*)
  - Grouping Selector (,)

### **TagName Selector -->**

  - To target the element based on tagname itself we have to use tagName selector.
  - The symbol was the tagName itself.

### **Universal Selector -->**

  - It will target all the elements in the document including body tag.
  - The symbols used is Asterisk (*).

### **Id Name Selector -->**
  
  - To target the elements uniquely we have to use an id name. 
  - In CSS id name can be duplicated also there is no problem.
  - But once we moved to advanced languages. Repetition of id name will not work. 
    So it is highly recommended not to use it from now on.
  - The symbol used is hash (#).

### **Class Name Selector: -->**

  - when we want to give same CSS to the more than one elements then we have to use class.
  - The symbol used is dot (.)

### **Grouping Selector: -->**

  - To target multiple elements at a time we have to use a grouping selector.
  - Whenever we need to pass similar properties for multiple elements we can use a grouping selector.
  - The symbol used to combine all elements is comma(,)
