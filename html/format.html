        <h2>Nature Essay</h2>
        Nature is the natural, physical, material world or universe. <br>
        “Nature” can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. <br>
        It ranges in scale from the subatomic to the cosmic. <br>
        Our planet is rich in nature. <br>
        Natural things look beautiful and attractive. <br>
        Nature has flowing rivers, beautiful valleys, high mountains, singing birds, the oceans, the blue sky, different seasons, the rain, the beautiful moonlight etc. <br>
        The beauty of nature is matchless. <br>
        The blessings of nature on human beings are innumerable. <br>

        <h2>Importance and Role of Nature</h2>
        If there were no nature, we wouldn’t be alive. <br>
        Humankind is dependent on nature. <br>
        We get oxygen to breathe from plants and trees. <br>
        Thus, our respiratory system is regulated by nature. <br>
        Not only this, nature has some magical healing powers which help <i>patients suffering</i> from various diseases to recover faster. <br>
        Every minute spent in the lap of nature gives a refreshing and rejuvenating feeling. <br>
        It lowers the cortisol, commonly known as the stress hormone. <br>
        Even placing some nice plants around the work window will lead to lower stress. <br>
        Nature enhances our brain’s activity and makes us concentrate better and be more focused. <br>
        This makes our brains more creative and imaginative. <br>
        <q>Spending time in nature will provide a healthier and longer life.</q> <br>

        <b>Nature is very powerful and unique. </b><br>
        <strong>Nature is also considered a source of education. </strong><br>
        <strong>We can learn humility from trees, the sturdiness from the mountains, and to smile from flowers and buds to keep smiling in tough phases of life.</strong> <br>
        
        <i>The natural cycle of our ecosystem is very necessary. </i><br>
        <em>Ecosystems contain biotic or living parts, as well as abiotic factors or nonliving parts. </em><br>
        Biotic factors include plants, animals, and other <mark>organisms</mark>. <br>
        Abiotic factors include rocks, temperature, and humidity. <br>
        Every factor in an ecosystem depends on every other factor, either directly or indirectly. <br>
        We must take care of all the components of the ecosystem as it fulfils all our needs. <br>
        
        <h2>Nature Conservation</h2>
        <i>The resources provided on the earth are limited. </i><br>
        If we continue to deplete the resources at this pace, then they will soon exhaust. <br>
        Urbanisation and development have resulted in excessive use of resources. <br>
        For example, we are cutting trees to make houses, roads, and railway tracks. <br>
        We are mining minerals and fossil fuels for transportation activities. <br>
        We are extensively using water for agriculture and other activities. <br>
        Our comfort has led to the destruction of nature. <br>
        Deforestation, global warming, wildlife destruction, environmental pollution, ecosystem imbalance etc., <br>
        are the consequences that threaten biodiversity and life on earth. <br>
        To overcome them, we need to conserve nature. <br>
        
        <br>
        Conserving nature means protecting, preserving and restoring biodiversity. <br>
        We can do so by taking care of small things such as making use of: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose, Recycle. <br>
        It will help in reducing waste management. <br>
        We should plant trees in our surroundings and increase the greenery around us. <br>
        Conserving water and saving it is also a way of conserving nature. <br>
        We can also conserve rainwater by adopting the rainwater harvesting method. <br>
        We must use and promote alternative energy sources such as solar energy and wind energy and thus adopt sustainable development concepts. <br>
        We can conserve nature by taking care of small activities at home. <br>
        These activities include switching off the lights, fans, and AC when not in use, switching to public transport and carpooling, <br>
        composting waste at home, using recyclable bags and containers, and educating our children about climate change and nature conservation. <br>
