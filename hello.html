    <p>In the kingdom of Mahishmati, Bahubali and Devasena were once the epitome of love. Their bond was forged in trust, respect, and an unshakable belief in each other. <br/>Bahubali, noble and righteous, believed that Devasena’s heart belonged to him alone.
    <br>
    But shadows crept into their paradise. Bhallaladeva, cunning and ambitious, began weaving his way into Devasena’s life. <br/>What started as subtle conversations and stolen glances grew into something deeper. Devasena, torn between loyalty and desire, found herself entangled in Bhallaladeva’s charm.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sources close to the royal court confirm that Bahubali confronted Devasena after learning of her betrayal.</li>
          <li>Witnesses describe the breakup as “heart‑wrenching yet dignified,” with Bahubali walking away in silence.</li>
          <li>The affair has sent ripples across the kingdom, raising questions about loyalty, honor, and the future of Mahishmati’s royal alliances.</li>
